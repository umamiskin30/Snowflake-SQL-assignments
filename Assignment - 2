-- 1. Evaluate the median severity value of accidents caused by various Motorcycles.

LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicle_types AS VT ON VT.VEHICLE_CODE = V.VEHICLE_TYPE
WHERE VT.VEHICLE_TYPE LIKE 'Motorcycle%'
GROUP BY 1

FROM accident AS A 
LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicles AS V ON V.ACCIDENT_INDEX = A.ACCIDENT_INDEX 
LEFT OUTER JOIN vehicle_types AS VT ON VT.VEHICLE_CODE = V.VEHICLE_TYPE
